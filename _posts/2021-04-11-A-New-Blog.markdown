### Abstract

It seems to happen in the life of some tinkerers that the hermeticism of their avocation gets a little whack.

This blog is to let an abundance of ideas (a group that has given me claustrophobia) out into the world to travel and experience something other than the drab walls of my slow, ambling mind.

Bon voyage, clever ideas! Feel free not to write!
